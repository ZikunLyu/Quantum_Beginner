## What is Quantum Computing?
Quantum computing is essentially harnessing and exploiting the amazing laws of quantum mechanics to process information.   
**A traditional computer** uses long strings of “bits,” which encode either a zero or a one.   
**A quantum computer** uses quantum bits, or qubits.   
What's the difference?  
**A qubit** is a quantum system that encodes the zero and the one into two distinguishable quantum states. But, because qubits behave quantumly, we can capitalize on the phenomena of "superposition" and "entanglement."

## Superposition
Superposition is essentially the ability of a quantum system to be in multiple states at the same time — that is, something can be “here” and “there,” or “up” and “down” at the same time.

## Entanglement
Entanglement is an extremely strong correlation that exists between quantum particles — so strong, in fact, that two or more quantum particles can be inextricably linked in perfect unison, even if separated by great distances. The particles are so intrinsically connected, they can be said to “dance” in instantaneous, perfect unison, even when placed at opposite ends of the universe. This seemingly impossible connection inspired Einstein to describe entanglement as “spooky action at a distance.”
